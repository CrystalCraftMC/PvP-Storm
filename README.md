PvPStorm
=========

## Overview
PvPStorm is a Spigot plugin that enables you to fight your players with the power of the gods! Take on your players in
a totally new and fun way that can instantly add more active PvP to your server.

## Powers and Abilities
In a PvP storm, there are the players, and there is the Stormer. The Stormer is the player that has the special powers
and abilities over the other players. The Stormer has three powers available to him:

1. Flare Power
2. Vanish Ability
3. Timewarp Ability

### Flare Power
The Flare power is a quick and high-powered attack that is good in tight situations when multiple players are ganging
up on the same person. Flare will instantly damage all of the players in a small radius of the Stormer at the expense of
some of the health of the Stormer. This is good shocker to players attacking as it will penetrate through all armor and
potion effects that the player has enabled.

### Vanish Ability
Vanish ability is fairly self-explanatory. This ability will set the player invisible at a moment's notice at the cost
of some of their health. This is better than just a potion as it has the potential to be used an unlimited amount of
times, as compared to drinking a single potion and being done with it.

### Timewarp Ability
The Timewarp ability is useful for tight situations and makes for a quick getaway. When using this, it will teleport
the Stormer through time and back to a former position they once were at (or essentially, they will get a big
knockback). The cost of using this ability is a few minutes of slowness, so while it will get you away from a cluster
of people or out of a dangerous situation, it also provides the ability for the players to catch back up with you.

## Rewards
